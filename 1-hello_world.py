# applicationâ€™s module or package, which is used by Flask to find resources,
# templates, static files, instance folder, etc. '__name__' is a built-in

    # This function is called when the root URL is accessed. It returns a string,
    # which will be displayed on the client's web browser. The return value can
    # also be more complex, such as an HTML template.
